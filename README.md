# PokemonGame
Single-player Pokemon game coded in C++

A fun, single-player game with themes incorporated from the Pokémon franchise. Built using an object-oriented infrastructure
and implemented using a Model-View-Controller pattern to update statuses of Pokémon and display game
objects on a dynamic UI. 

External features: Project includes a Makefile to speed up the compile time of the project and an input handler to
catch all user errors.

C++ Principles: dynamic memory allocation used to create Pokémon, linked lists in the STL Library to replace arrays, 
linked list traversal and element insertion/deletion, destructors, exception handling, object pointers, inheritance,
polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
